To install the required libraries, run:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Dataset
The project utilizes publicly available datasets, such as:

MovieLens: For movie recommendations
Goodbooks-10k: For book recommendations
You can download the dataset from the respective official sources or use any custom dataset with similar attributes.

Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/recommendation-system-ml.git
cd recommendation-system-ml

Install the dependencies:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Preprocess the dataset:
Clean and format the data for training and evaluation.
Handle missing values and normalize features if required.
Run the script to train models:
bash
Usage

Results
The models achieve the following performance on the test dataset:

Collaborative Filtering: RMSE = 0.85
Content-Based Filtering: Precision@10 = 72%
Hybrid Model: F1-Score = 78%
Future Work
Enhance the hybrid recommendation system with graph-based approaches.
Implement reinforcement learning for adaptive recommendations.
Scale the system for large datasets using distributed computing.
