Recommendation System Using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project focuses on building a recommendation system using machine learning techniques. Recommendation systems are widely used across various domains, including e-commerce, streaming platforms, and social media, to suggest products, content, or connections to users based on their preferences and behavior.

Features
User-Based and Item-Based Collaborative Filtering
Content-Based Recommendations
Hybrid Recommendation System
Integration of Deep Learning Models (e.g., Neural Collaborative Filtering)
Model Evaluation Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and RMSE
Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or later
Libraries:
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
tensorflow (if using deep learning methods)
To install the required libraries, run:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Dataset
The project utilizes publicly available datasets, such as:

MovieLens: For movie recommendations
Goodbooks-10k: For book recommendations
You can download the dataset from the respective official sources or use any custom dataset with similar attributes.

Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/recommendation-system-ml.git
cd recommendation-system-ml

Install the dependencies:
